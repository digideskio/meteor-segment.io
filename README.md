# Deprecated

Since Meteor 1.3 ships with support for `npm install` and ES2015 modules support on the client+server, this wrapping package is no longer required or recommended. Please update to Meteor 1.3 and either use the official npm package maintained by the Segment team or one of the many derivatives.

The legacy README has [moved](README-legacy.md).
